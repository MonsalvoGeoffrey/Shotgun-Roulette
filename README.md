Simulating the rules of the horror game [Buckshot Roulette](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette) and run simulation with various strategies to check their win rate against each other strategies.

> [!warning]
> Does not simulate items yet

### Strategies currently implemented:

- Random
- Always Shot Self
- Always Shot Opponent

### Planned strategy

- Shot when more blanks than live
- Shot when more or equal blanks than live

---

I also think I'll separate the logic in item strategy and shooting strategy.
