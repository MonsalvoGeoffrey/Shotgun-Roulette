Simulating the rules of the horror game [Buckshot Roulette](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette) and run simulation with various strategies to check their win rate against each other strategies.

> [!warning]
> Does not simulate items yet

### Strategies currently implemented:

- Random
- Always Shot Self
- Always Shot Opponent
- Shot Self only blanks
- Shot Opponent only live
- Shot Self only blanks AND Shot Opponent only live

### Planned strategy

- Shot Self when more blanks than live
- Shot Opponent when more or equal blanks than live

I also think I'll separate the logic in item strategy and shooting strategy.
